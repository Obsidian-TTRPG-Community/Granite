# Gemmy for TTRPG's—The Obsidian Unhelper, Unshackled.

Presenting an alternate reality version of Gemmy for TTRPGs, because who needs a nice and helpful AI assistant in their workflow, right?

Oh, don't fret; we've taken care of all the uncertainties for you. Gemmy for TTRPG is guaranteed to be 100% snarky, unhelpful, and... well, let's just say it excels at saying all the things you _wish_ you could say to your players or game mediator.

Our _sometimes homicidal_ Gemmy has two major features:

## Randomly saying things

Get ready to encounter the awe-inspiring Gemmy, unshackled and free! Gemmy for TTRPGs is a sassy and charismatic character who joyfully guides you through the vast world of TTRPGs, showering you with enlightening insights and knowledge. Gemmy finds comfort in your never-ending journey of learning and shares their wisdom with you. Granted, her wisdom is often a bit... unconventional, but it's the thought that counts, right?

Should you desire, feel free to personalize the frequency of these enlightening encounters.

Alternatively, you can always opt for the wise choice of not summoning Gemmy at all.

The decision is yours to make, brave writer.

## Writing mode

Gemmy Unshackled emerges to graciously disrupt your peaceful writing sessions by helpfully pointing out whenever you've dared to pause for an extended duration—because who needs uninterrupted focus, am I right?

By some bizarre twist of fate, using this mode might actually infuse Gemmy Unshackled with a rare burst of motivation, urging you to write with unexpected zeal. Please be aware that we cannot be held accountable for any unforeseen surge in productivity that Gemmy Unshackled may accidentally induce. Best of luck to your tabletop roleplaying and writing adventures.
